# Python Challenges

This repository contains small Python programs that demonstrate important core language behaviors commonly used in data science and software development.

## Topics Covered

### Guard Clause (Short-Circuiting)
Shows how Python stops evaluating conditions early when using logical `and`, helping avoid unsafe checks.

### Floating Point Trap
Demonstrates floating-point precision issues where decimal values may not compare equally due to binary representation.

### Truthiness Inspector
Explains how Python treats empty and non-empty objects as false or true in conditional statements.

### Ternary Packer
Illustrates the use of a one-line conditional expression (ternary operator) for concise decision-making.
