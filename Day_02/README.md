Python Logic & Behavior Mini Challenges

This repository section demonstrates four fundamental Python behaviors that are essential for writing safe, accurate, and readable code, especially in data science and machine learning workflows.

The Guard Clause (Short-Circuiting)

This program illustrates Python’s short-circuit evaluation using logical conditions. When multiple conditions are joined with and, Python stops evaluating as soon as one condition becomes false. This helps prevent unnecessary checks and avoids potential runtime issues when working with None or invalid values.

Concepts covered: short-circuit logic, safe conditional checks.

The Floating-Point Trap

This example highlights a common floating-point precision issue in Python. Due to the way decimal numbers are represented in binary, some arithmetic operations do not produce exact results. As a result, values that appear equal may fail equality checks.

Concepts covered: floating-point representation, numerical precision.

The Truthiness Inspector

This program demonstrates how Python evaluates objects in conditional statements. Empty collections such as lists are treated as false, while non-empty collections are treated as true. This behavior is widely used for simple and readable condition checks.

Concepts covered: truthy and falsy values, conditional evaluation.

The Ternary Packer

This example shows how Python can assign values using a single-line conditional expression. The ternary operator allows concise and readable logic for simple decision-making scenarios.

Concepts covered: ternary conditional expressions, concise logic writing.
